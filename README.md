# Grid-Connected PV System Simulink Model

A Simulink model of a 108 kW two-stage grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system.

## Key Features
- PV Array Model (REC Solar REC215PE modules)
- DC-DC Boost Converter with P&O MPPT Algorithm
- Three-Phase VSI with dq-Control and PLL
- LCL Output Filter

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the main `.slx` file in MATLAB/Simulink (Requires Simscape Electrical).
3. Run the simulation.

> **Note:** A detailed README with installation instructions, results, and analysis is coming soon.
